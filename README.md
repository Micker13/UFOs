# UFOs

## Overview

In this assignment, we have applied the use of Javascript to HTML to improve and expand on website usages.  This allows for increased visualization and data analytics within our websites.  This work will allos us to build a dynamic webpage to show data we have gathered / analyzed.

Using CSS and bootstrap we add javascript to a constructed HTML file on a local site.  The HTML page makes use of a data javascript and an application javascript to create and filter a table of UFO data

## Resources

Javascript
HTML
Visual Studio Code

## Results

On the webpage, we have created a filter which will allow users to filter through the UFO sighting results by numerous possible criteria.  This will help to limit the large amount of data that is shown in the table.

## Summary

Although we have added filters, this is still a difficult table to make use of.  If the location you are thinking of doesn't have a sighting, there is no way to know prior to filtering.  It would be beneficial to contruct a summary table which allows for an easier visualization of the data we are discussing.
